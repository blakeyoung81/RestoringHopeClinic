  },
  {
    question: "Can I volunteer or support the clinic's development?",

  },
  {
    question: "Where exactly is the clinic located?",
    answer: "We're located at 828 S Seven Hills Ct, Fayetteville, AR 72701, within the 7Hills Homeless Center campus. This 10-acre integrated facility allows us to provide coordinated healthcare and housing services."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your long-term goals beyond the initial launch?",
    answer: "Phase II (1-2 years) includes expanding mental health services, developing transitional housing, and creating a fully integrated campus. Our ultimate goal is to create a replicable model that can be implemented in other communities facing similar challenges."
